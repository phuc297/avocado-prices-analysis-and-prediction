# Avocado Prices Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing avocado prices across different regions in the United States and predicting future trends using time series models. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training for forecasting.

## Introduction
Avocados are a popular fruit in the United States, and their prices vary significantly across regions and time. This project aims to:
- Analyze historical avocado price trends.
- Explore regional differences in prices, volumes, and revenues.
- Build predictive models to forecast future prices.

## Analysis
Key steps in the analysis:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
3. Visualization of regional and temporal price variations.
4. Feature engineering for model training.

## Models
The project uses the following models for forecasting:
- **ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
- **SARIMA**: Seasonal ARIMA for capturing seasonality in the data.
